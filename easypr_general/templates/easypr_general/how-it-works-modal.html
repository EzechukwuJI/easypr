       			Routing your contents through easyPR is pretty simple. Log on to www.easyPR.ng, click the ‘Submit Content’ button. This action will take you to the several plans we have. Go through the plans carefully. Each content type has several plans underneath it. For instance, press release has different plans depending on the number of media platforms you want your contents placed. Once you have made up your mind on the plan and have chosen, you will be redirected into the content submission page. In this page, you will be required to enter the details of the story, the company behind it, the person to be quoted in the story and his portfolio etc. You will also be required to select the media the content will be placed and then you can copy the content and place in a space provided or attach the document file. Once you click the submit button, the system will route your submission to easyPR dashboard and you will get a notification that your submission was successful and that you will be notified once your content is published in selected media. It is that simple.
